# 99-Problems

This is yet another repository with solutions for the famous 99 problems. 
The entire scope of this challenge is to  find **the most elegant solution** for a particular problem, 
not just a working one. 
This all started with prolog, if I'm not mistaken. You can find the original problems [here](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/). 
This is more for my endevour of learning OCaml, Haskell, Scala and Rust. 
I also added C++ just for fun. (It's my favorite programming language :D)
For the programming languages that I couldn't find a list, I've just reused the OCaml version :).
